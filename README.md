# Library Management System

A modern **Library Management System** built with **Spring Boot** and **Hibernate** that provides comprehensive features for managing books, authors, genres, publishers, and user reservations. The system supports role-based access control (Admin and User), allowing administrators to manage books, while users can browse and reserve books.

## Features:
- **Book Management**: CRUD operations for books, authors, genres, and publishers.
- **User Management**: Role-based authentication and authorization using **JWT**.
- **Reservation System**: Users can reserve books, with available stock and reservability checks.
- **UUID-based IDs**: Unique identifiers for all entities to ensure security and scalability.
- **Security**: JWT authentication and **UUID** for secure identification, backed by **Spring Security**.
- **Database**: Integrated with **MySQL** for reliable and efficient data storage.

## Technologies:
- **Spring Boot**: For the core backend framework.
- **Hibernate**: For ORM and database management.
- **MySQL**: For the relational database.
- **JWT**: For secure token-based authentication.
- **UUID**: For unique, secure identifiers for all entities.
